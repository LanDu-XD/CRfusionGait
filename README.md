# CRfusionGait: Camera and Radar Sensor Fusion Gait Recognition dataset
CRfusionGait is an open-source gait recognition dataset collected with camera and radar sensors. It can be used to study multi-modality gait recognition and single-modality gait recognition based on radar or camera sensors. Our artical "Robust Gait Recognition based on Deep CNNs with Camera and Radar Sensor Fusion" is undergoing review. Our dataset and codes will be made public in the near future. We hope that our work can serve as a baseline and inspire further research. Following, we introduce the composition and implementation details of this dataset.
